# Bike-power

Bike power is a mobile application whose main purpose is to measure the power of bicycle's pedals. 
The user is required to enter his weight in kg's as well as his bike's weight.
After that he is introduced to new fragment which contains a section for the power of the pedals (in Wats) and for the bikes speed per hour 
initially is set to zero. We are using Google maps API to measure the path he has passed from point A to point B.

The application's interface is really simple i.e. user friendly. It has four fragments for Home, History, Settings and About respectively.
